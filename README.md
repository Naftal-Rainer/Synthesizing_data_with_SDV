What do you do when the data you have is insufficient for you project? One way to combat this is synthesizing a new set of data based on the available data.

Python offers a package `SDV` which generates synthetic data based on the dataset provided  by applying mathematical techniques and machine learning models. 

The generated data could be a single-table, multi-table or time-series depending on the scheme provided in the environment.

The generated data has the same format properties and statistics as the provided dataset.

The project illustrates a simple generation of synthetic data.
